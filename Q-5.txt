The second number, when the digits are reversed, becomes "yx".

Let's find these numbers now:

Since each digit can be a value from 0 to 9 and we know that "x" and "y" are consecutive, the possible pairs (considering "xy" as a two-digit number) can be: 12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89.

Now, we know that the sum of these two numbers is a perfect square. Let's add each pair with its reverse and check which one gives a perfect square:

12 + 21 = 33
23 + 32 = 55
34 + 43 = 77
45 + 54 = 99
56 + 65 = 121
67 + 76 = 143
78 + 87 = 165
89 + 98 = 187

From these calculations, only the pair 56 and 65 sum to a perfect square, 121, which is 11^2.

So, the two numbers are 56 and 65, and the square root of their sum is 11.
